- metadata get, we see:

	require 'vips8'
	im = Vips::Image.new_from_file "/data/john/pics/wtc.jpg"
	im.get "icc-profile-data"
	=> [0, #<GLib::Value:0x1661df8 ptr=0x1e93c00 own=true>]

  strange, what's the [0, ] doing there?

  affects get_value in image.rb, needs to extract the 1st element before
  unwrapping



- try getting ICC profiles ... do they come out as strings? should we unwrap?

- need to add [] and () overloads to Ruby bindings

- ruby () overload could accept ranges, eg.

        x = im(2..100, 2..100)

  and return an image, cf. crop
