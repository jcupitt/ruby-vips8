- mail about the getpoint unimplemented error

- Vips::Argument can now keep @prop member, perhaps?

- update daltonize8.rb with final code

- add spec tests for .recomb() and .conv() with array args

- add complex constants, eg. 

	Complex(1, 2)
	=> (1+2i)

- more examples, more realistic examples
